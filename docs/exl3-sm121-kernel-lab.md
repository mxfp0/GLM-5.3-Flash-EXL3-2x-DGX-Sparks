# Atlas EXL3 SM121 Kernel Lab — engineering log

Last updated: 2026-08-31

## Status

The first optimization stage is implemented but not yet timed on an isolated
SM121 device:

- reuse ExLlamaV3's packed ABI and direct CUDA kernels;
- accept arbitrary model/operator shapes rather than a model registry;
- validate MCG K1-K8 with independent materialized and streaming CPU oracles;
- enumerate ExLlamaV3's built-in tile shapes and SM quotas;
- emit native Atlas receipts for every exact measured tactic;
- keep the production ExLlamaV3 pin unchanged while enabling an isolated
  current-upstream comparison from this development-only source checkout.

No speedup is claimed until the checked-in sweep runs on SM121.

## Repository and architecture boundary

CUDA/runtime work belongs in this serving repository. Atlas owns profiling,
candidate decisions, receipt import, and promotion gates. This lab is the
bridge: it produces `atlas.kernel-benchmark/v1` measurements that Atlas can
rank without importing CUDA infrastructure.

The lab is development-only source: the production Dockerfile neither copies
nor installs `kernel_lab/`, and no production launch path imports it. Receipts
come from a source checkout, never from a served image.

The surrounding deployment remains GLM-specific, but the kernel-lab API is
not. `model_id`, `operator`, and `phase` are receipt provenance strings.
Compatibility is based on hardware/software identity, representation ABI,
M/N/K, tensor-parallel world size, grouped state, and backend commit.

The five unrelated untracked download/cutover scripts discovered in this
checkout were preserved and are not part of the kernel-lab branch.

## ABI decision

The lab reuses ExLlamaV3's serialized MCG ABI without modification:

| Field | Dtype | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `trellis` | int16 | `[K/16, N/16, 16*bits]` |
| `suh` | fp16 | `[K]` |
| `svh` | fp16 | `[N]` |
| `mcg` | int32 | scalar marker `0xCBAC1FED` / `-877912083` |

The matrix convention is `A[M,K] @ W[K,N]`. Trellis tiles are 16×16 in
ExLlamaV3 tensor-core lane order. The direct MCG adapter now accepts every
integer upstream bitrate K1-K8. Fractional model-wide rates remain allocations
across integer-rate tensors, not an invented fractional tensor format.

Production remains pinned to ExLlamaV3
`c5d9c657966ffeeaa9353f0cc899f18629da4a13`. An alternate immutable upstream
commit can still be built and self-checked as an isolated source-checkout
experiment, but this lab is development-only: the production Dockerfile carries
no build stamp or copy for it. Measured receipts take the runtime source commit
from `--runtime-commit` or from the Git identity of the clean checkout that
produced them, and fail instead of emitting a receipt when no full SHA
resolves. The `RUNTIME_SOURCE_COMMIT` and `EXLLAMAV3_COMMIT` environment
values are declarations, not attestation: the first is honored only when it is
exactly the loaded source, and the second must be supplied before the metadata
module is imported because the pinned fallback describes only the production
pin and cannot prove an arbitrary installed extension's identity. Unknown or
mismatched backend/source identity is not measurement evidence.

## Reference and direct paths

`kernel_lab/exl3/reference.py` implements the authoritative bit order,
tensor-core permutation, MCG procedural codebook, and 128-wide
Hadamard/scaling transforms in NumPy.

Two correctness paths are intentionally independent:

1. decode and materialize the complete weight, then multiply;
2. transform activations, decode one packed 16×16 tile, consume it immediately,
   and discard it.

The SM121 direct path calls ExLlamaV3 `exl3_gemm` with packed trellis tensors.
Full reconstruction is used only for separately timed correctness and
diagnostic baselines. It is outside the direct CUDA event range and receipts
set `full_precision_materialized=false` for the measured execution path.

## First SM121 tactic surface

The pinned extension already exposes controls that production normally hides:

- automatic dispatch/autotuning;
- four compiled GEMM tile shapes, filtered by exact K/N compatibility;
- an explicit number of participating SMs.

The lab now measures automatic dispatch plus each compatible tile at quarter,
half, and full-device SM quotas. This yields a hardware-derived dispatch table
instead of rules tied to a model name.

The current upstream ExLlamaV3 candidate at
`0c49587a7c235e6303a6bbedc8b665272ad3a2ea` additionally contains a QTIP-style
small-M FP16 GEMV and a fused mul1 int8-activation GEMV. Those are candidate
experiments, not silently adopted production code.

SM121 is consumer Blackwell. NVIDIA's current CuTe implementation directs
SM120/121 kernels to warp-level `mma.sync`, not datacenter-Blackwell
`tcgen05`. Therefore the first experiment stays on ExLlamaV3's CUDA
`mma.sync` path. CuTe/CUTLASS remains useful for layout and medium-M scheduling
once measurements demonstrate a gap.

## Workload input

The benchmark accepts any exact shape as `OPERATOR:K:N` or a JSON workload
list. No code change is needed for a future model. Defaults are generic
square/expand/contract shape classes. Early GLM-5.2 and Hy4 shapes remain only
under explicit `--fixture` names for reproducibility.

The default M sweep is `1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128`. The first performance gate
should focus on M=1/2/4/8; wider M values locate the direct-to-reconstruction
crossover.

## Evidence so far

The entries below are the author's recorded results for the dates given. They
were not re-run at the development-only cutover head and are not exact-head
qualification; the counts belong to their own runs and are not reconciled into
a single figure.

### Measured — portable host

- Focused kernel-lab suite: 19 passed.
- K1-K8 deterministic pack/unpack: passed.
- K1-K8 streaming matmul versus materialized oracle: passed.
- Worst maximum absolute error across that sweep: `1.08e-6`.
- No dense tensor exists in the streaming oracle.

### Previously measured — GB10 compatibility

- NumPy K3 packing matched the official ExLlamaV3 CUDA packer byte-for-byte on
  deterministic and randomized fixtures.
- NumPy MCG decoding matched the CUDA decoder for all 65,536 states.

### Not measured

- Direct tactic latency on an isolated SM121.
- Effective bandwidth/TFLOP/s and reconstruction overhead on target shapes.
- Pinned 0.0.43 versus current-upstream small-M GEMV.
- mul1 int8-activation crossover.

The current development host exposes no NVIDIA CUDA device. Earlier available
Sparks were occupied by an unrelated two-node service, so no disruptive timing
run was attempted.

## Decision gate

Run the automatic path and tactic sweep on an isolated Spark, import the
generated catalog into Atlas, then choose the next patch from measured data:

- `reconstruction`: optimize bit extraction/register prefetch and K splitting;
- `memory_bandwidth_or_pipeline`: prioritize packed layout, coalescing, and
  multi-matrix fusion;
- `compute_or_launch`: reduce cooperative synchronization/launch work or move
  next to grouped MoE;
- direct loses to reconstruct-then-GEMM: investigate a medium-M tile-local
  decode/MMA kernel or move the crossover rather than forcing direct execution.

Only after that gate should a new CUDA schedule be promoted into the runtime.
